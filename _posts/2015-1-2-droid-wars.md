## Problem Statement

With crime in Gotham continuously on the rise, Batman is worried that his Utility Belt may not be enough anymore. So he needs you to create a “Bat-App” for him that will help him in his endeavours. He needs to maintain a record of all the wrongdoers spreading havoc in his city. This app should have the following screens :

- **Home Screen**
    This screen has 2 buttons - New record and View Records. Clicking on New record opens up a screen to create a new record and clicking on view existing records opens a list of records stored.


- **New Record** 
    When the user clicks on the new record button he will be taken to a new screen which will have a form asking the user for various inputs like criminal's name , age , gender , crimes and last known/seen location. There will also be a button to save these records in a database..


- **View Records** 
    This screen will consist of a list of all the records stored locally. On clicking any item, the details of that particular criminal must be shown in the Details Screen


- **Details** 
    Here is where the details of criminals that are stored in the database must be shown.

## Bonus Points For

- Elegant User Interface
- If images of each criminal are stored and displayed
- Clicking on the last known location shows it on a map. You can take the latitude & longitude of the location from the user at the time of filling a new entry. A better option can be to just open the map, let the user pinpoint the location and save the latitude & longitude of that location. ( Refer Maps SDK for Android, Google Maps Android API v2 - Tutorial )
