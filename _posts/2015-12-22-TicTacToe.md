### **Tic-Tac-Toe**

Everyone of you must have heard of the game Tic Tac Toe. Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 Grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Create an android app for the classic “Tic-Tac-Toe” game. Your app should consist of :

- **Main Screen**: It should consist of two text fields, for containing names of players X-O and two buttons, "Play" and “View Highscores". Clicking on "Play” opens up a screen containing the grid for playing tic-tac-toe and clicking on "View Highscores" opens a list of highscores.
- **Play**: This screen must have a centered text view on the top which displays the name of the player and the sign of play ( X or O ) having the current turn. On changing turns, the name of player and the sign of play ( X or O ) must change simultaneously. The screen must be occupied with a 3x3 grid view. The players can play the game by simply touching on each tile of the grid. On game over, a game over dialog box should pop out.
- **Game Over**: A Dialog Box should appear when one of the players wins or if there is a draw. If the name of winner is already stored in the database, his overall score must be incremented by 1, or a new entry must be made in the database, with a score of 1 point. The dialog box should specify the name of the player who won & and the score of both players after adding score of the current game. 
- **View Highscores**: This screen must display the list of players with their names and highscores.


### **Bonus Points**

 - Elegant User Interface.
 - Sort the players according to their high Scores.
 - Implement a fade-in appear of X and O symbols in the tiles instead of straightaway displaying them, when a player touches a tile of grid, playing his move. You can also implement any other animation for rendering of symbols.
 - Drop down suggestions containing names of players who played recently, while typing in the name of players (On the Main Screen).
